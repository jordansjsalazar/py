My cousins came to live with me by chance. This arrangement began nearly half
a year ago.

I picked them up at the training camp across the mountain path from town in
the early evening.

It was a cold day, during the rainy season, and I was eager to get back, since
I had left an object in town for appraisal.

Shera
Do you have everything?

Salemi Narat
I believe so.

Basari Narat
...

Shera
Well, great! Then let's go-

Shera
(I would prefer that they weren't forced to wait for me, but I am in a bit of
a hurry to return to Mr. Lara in town.)

This game uses a text prompt feature. The prompter will display potential
actions for Shera to decide between.

The prompter may accept other commands, some of which may affect gameplay. For
a full list, type "cmd".
